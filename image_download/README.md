# Download scripts for the satellite images

To download all images, simply modify the `download_all.ps1` (for Windows Powershell) or `download_all.sh` (for Unix-based systems) script to change the file path where the images are stored, then execute that script. It may take some time to download all the files, and will require approximately ~5.5 GB of disk space once downloaded.
